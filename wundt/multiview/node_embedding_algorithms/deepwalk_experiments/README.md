## Deepwalk algorithm Embeddings
This module intended to show performance of deepwalk algorithm on organization data.

###  Remarks
Deepwalk algorithm algorithm works for undirected, unweighted and single layer graphs. So before using deepwalk algorithm

### Requirements

### Steps

#### 1. Install deepwalk
#### 2. Create unweighted, undirected graph's edge list file
#### 3. Create embeddings for users using deepwalk
#### 4. Visualize embeddings on 3D/2D
